This project predicts the next dayâ€™s stock closing price using historical data from Yahoo Finance. Features like Open, High, Low, and Volume are used to train a Linear Regression or Random Forest model. The results are visualized by comparing actual vs predicted closing prices.
Hereâ€™s a structured summary for your stock price prediction project:

---

### âœ… **â—‹ Task Objective**

To predict the **next dayâ€™s closing stock price** using historical market data with features such as *Open*, *High*, *Low*, and *Volume*.

---

### ðŸ“‚ **â—‹ Dataset Used**

* **Source**: Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` Python library
* **Stock**: Apple Inc. (`AAPL`)
* **Time Period**: January 2020 to December 2023
* **Features Used**: Open, High, Low, Volume
* **Target Variable**: Next dayâ€™s Close price

---

### ðŸ¤– **â—‹ Models Applied**

* **Linear Regression**
* (Optional alternative: **Random Forest Regressor**)

---

### ðŸ“Š **â—‹ Key Results and Findings**

* The model was trained using historical price features to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price.
* **Evaluation metrics** like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score were used to assess accuracy.
* The plotted **Actual vs Predicted Closing Prices** show the model captures general price trends but may not predict exact values due to market volatility.
* **Linear Regression** is simple and interpretable, while **Random Forest** may provide better performance with non-linear patterns.
